## Why This Exists

Revenue Operations teams spend hours pulling data from HubSpot, building spreadsheets, and answering the same questions every week:

- *"What's our pipeline looking like?"*
- *"Who are the top-performing reps this quarter?"*
- *"What's our win rate trend?"*
- *"Show me the full funnel conversion rates."*
- *"Which lead sources are driving the most revenue?"*

**This skill turns your AI agent into a RevOps analyst.** Ask questions in plain English, get instant answers backed by live HubSpot data — no dashboards to build, no reports to schedule, no BI tools to configure.

1. **Connects** to HubSpot via OAuth 2.0 (browser-based, read-only, secure)
2. **Auto-discovers** your CRM schema — objects, properties, pipelines, associations
3. **Computes 40+ RevOps metrics** across pipeline, revenue, funnel, activity, and team
4. **Answers natural-language questions** — no SQL, no code, just ask
5. **Generates reports** — markdown tables, CSV exports, and charts

## Why Not Just Use HubSpot's MCP?

HubSpot ships an official MCP server at [`mcp.hubspot.com/anthropic`](https://developers.hubspot.com/mcp). It's genuinely great, and you should probably install it too:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http hubspot https://mcp.hubspot.com/anthropic
```

But MCP alone is a **data access layer** — it gives the model tools to fetch records, then expects the model to compute the numbers inline. That works for exploratory questions. It doesn't work for CFO-grade RevOps reporting. Here's what this skill adds on top:

|  | HubSpot MCP (raw) | This skill |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | Data access layer — thin wrapper over HubSpot's REST API | Opinionated RevOps analyst — skill + 40+ pandas metric engines + CLI |
| **Numbers** | Model computes inline from raw records — drifts run-to-run | Deterministic pandas engines — byte-exact every run |
| **Scale** | Bounded by model context (~2k records practical limit) | Pages + aggregates server-side, handles 20k+ deals |
| **RevOps heuristics** | None — model re-derives from training each time | Baked in: win-rate n<5 filter, stage-age risk flags, velocity formula, fiscal-quarter parsing |
| **Report structure** | Varies per query — columns drift between runs | Locked templates — week-over-week comparison works |
| **Interpretation** | Optional, depends on how the user phrased the question | Mandatory: insights → risks → actions → drill-downs |
| **Write safety** | Exposes HubSpot's write endpoints — `crm_update_*`, `crm_delete_*` | Architecturally read-only — write code doesn't exist in the package |
| **Host reach** | Any MCP-compatible host (Claude Code, Cursor, Zed, Desktop) | Claude Code + Python CLI today; MCP wrapper on the roadmap |
| **Best for** | Freeform queries, cross-tool composition, small portals where exact numbers don't matter | Canned RevOps reports, audit-grade precision, medium-large portals, scheduled "Monday pipeline review" workflows |

### They compose — you can install both

This skill and HubSpot's MCP aren't competitors. MCP is the **transport layer**; this skill is the **opinion layer**. A future version of this skill will ship an MCP wrapper that calls HubSpot's MCP for raw data under the hood and layers the deterministic metric engines + report templates on top. Users who want raw CRM exploration install the HubSpot MCP. Users who want analyst-grade reporting install this skill. Users who want both install both — they don't conflict.

### When to reach for which

**Pick HubSpot's MCP if you're asking things like:**
- *"Find all companies in California with MRR > $50k whose primary contact matches /VP.*Engineering/"*
- *"What's this specific deal's associated line items and their product categories?"*
- *"Compare HubSpot pipeline coverage with the forecast in Salesforce"* (cross-tool queries)

**Pick this skill if you're asking things like:**
- *"What's our pipeline by stage this quarter?"* (canned report, precise numbers, interpreted)
- *"Who are the top 5 reps by win rate, excluding reps with fewer than 5 closed deals?"* (RevOps heuristic baked in)
- *"Give me the executive summary I can show in Monday's leadership meeting"* (locked template, week-over-week comparable)
- *"My HubSpot portal has 18,000 open deals — what's total pipeline coverage?"* (beyond MCP's context window)
- *"I need the same pipeline report every Monday at 9am, and the numbers must match the board deck"* (deterministic, auditable)

**The short version:** MCP gives you a HubSpot data hose. This skill gives you a RevOps analyst. Different jobs.

## Use with FlashClaw / OpenClaw

> **[FlashClaw](https://flashlabs.ai)** is the hosted, secure, enterprise-ready version of OpenClaw — built by [FlashLabs.ai](https://flashlabs.ai) for GTM teams that need production-grade AI agents with SOC 2 compliance, SSO, team management, and managed infrastructure. No self-hosting required.
>
> **[Get started with FlashClaw →](https://flashlabs.ai)**

### Install the Skill

**Option 1: From ClawHub (recommended)**
```bash
openclaw skill install hubspot-revops
```

**Option 2: From this repository**
```bash
# Clone into your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/yi-here/RevOps-CRM-Analyst-Skill-for-Hubspot.git \
  ~/.openclaw/skills/hubspot-revops

# Or for FlashClaw, add via the dashboard or:
flashclaw skill install hubspot-revops
```

**Option 3: Workspace-level**
```bash
# Copy the skill directory into your project
cp -r skills/hubspot-revops /your/workspace/.agents/skills/
```

### Configure

Register a HubSpot public app at https://developers.hubspot.com (see
[HubSpot Setup](#hubspot-setup) below) and set the client ID and secret in
your OpenClaw/FlashClaw environment:

```bash
# OpenClaw
export HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

# FlashClaw — use the secrets dashboard or:
flashclaw secret set HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
flashclaw secret set HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

On first run the skill opens a browser to complete HubSpot authorization;
tokens are cached under `~/.hubspot_revops/tokens.json` and refreshed
silently on subsequent runs. For fully headless CI, set
`HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` instead and the OAuth flow is skipped.

### Use It

Once installed, just talk to your agent:

```
You: What's our pipeline looking like?
Agent: [Connects to HubSpot, runs pipeline report, returns formatted results]

You: Who are the top reps this quarter?
Agent: [Generates rep scorecard with revenue, win rate, deal size per rep]

You: Compare Q1 vs Q2 revenue
Agent: [Runs revenue reports for both periods, shows comparison]
```

Or invoke directly:
```
/hubspot-revops pipeline
/hubspot-revops "What's our win rate?"
```

### Skill File Structure

```
skills/hubspot-revops/
├── SKILL.md              # Skill definition (OpenClaw/FlashClaw format)
└── scripts/
    └── install.sh        # Dependency installer
```

The `SKILL.md` declares `HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID` and `HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET` as required env vars, `python3` as a required binary, and includes full instructions for the agent to discover schema, run reports, and interpret results.

## HubSpot Setup

### Register a HubSpot OAuth App

The skill authenticates via OAuth 2.0 against a HubSpot public app that you
register once in your own HubSpot developer account. The app stays yours —
client ID and secret never leave your environment, and tokens are cached
locally under `~/.hubspot_revops/tokens.json` with `0600` permissions.

1. Go to https://developers.hubspot.com. If you do not already have a
   developer account, create one (free). Then open **Apps → Create app**.
2. **Auth tab:** set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:8976/callback`
   (or any free local port — set `HUBSPOT_REDIRECT_PORT` to match). Copy
   the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. **Scopes tab:** select these **read-only** permissions:

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `oauth` | Required for all OAuth flows |
| `crm.objects.contacts.read` | Contact data and lifecycle stages |
| `crm.objects.companies.read` | Company data |
| `crm.objects.deals.read` | Deal pipeline and revenue data |
| `crm.objects.line_items.read` | Line item / product data |
| `crm.schemas.custom.read` | Custom object schemas |
| `crm.objects.owners.read` | Sales rep / owner data |
| `sales-email-read` | Email engagement data |

4. Install the app to a HubSpot account (the app's **Install URL** on the
   Auth tab — this connects the app to your CRM portal so it can be
   authorized by the OAuth flow).
5. Export the credentials:
   ```bash
   export HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   export HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
6. Run any CLI command — e.g. `python -m hubspot_revops.cli schema`. The
   first run opens your browser, you click **Connect app**, and HubSpot
   redirects back to `http://localhost:8976/callback`. The skill caches the
   refresh token and future runs complete silently.

### Advanced: Use a Static Token (CI / Headless)

If you cannot open a browser (CI runners, Docker containers, FlashClaw
secrets-manager deployments), set `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` to a Private App
token or a pre-minted OAuth access token. When this variable is set the
skill skips the interactive OAuth flow entirely.

```bash
export HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=pat-na1-xxxxxxxx
python -m hubspot_revops.cli schema
```

### Security Notes

- **Read-only** — this skill never creates, updates, or deletes CRM data
- Credentials are passed via environment variables only (never committed to code)
- OAuth tokens are cached under `~/.hubspot_revops/tokens.json` with `0600` permissions
- Minimum-scope permissions — only what's needed for analytics
- Rate limit compliant: 100 req/10s (free), 190 req/10s (pro/enterprise), 5 req/s (search)

---

## Architecture

The skill is a layered, synchronous pipeline: **Auth → Client → Schema → Extractors → Metrics → Reports**. Each layer is independently testable, deterministic, and architecturally read-only.

## Engineering Highlights

These are the quiet correctness decisions that separate "code that runs" from "reports you can show the CFO." Each one exists because an earlier version got bitten — and each one is covered by tests in `tests/`.

### 1. Multi-Currency Isolation — Never Sum Across Currencies

HubSpot portals with deals in USD, JPY, EUR, and GBP quietly produce nonsense if you `sum(amount)` — ¥990,000 is not $990,000. Every money metric in this skill (`metrics/revenue.py`, `metrics/team.py`, `metrics/closed_lost.py`, `metrics/forecast_bucket.py`) buckets by `deal_currency_code` and returns a `by_currency: {USD: ..., JPY: ..., EUR: ...}` dict. A `primary_currency` field (highest deal count, alphabetical tiebreak) is exposed for back-compat callers that expect a single scalar. Team scorecards emit **one row per `(owner_id, currency)` pair** so rep performance is never cross-currency-smeared.

### 2. Stage Label Disambiguation for Multi-Pipeline Portals

Portals running "Sales" and "Japan" pipelines in parallel frequently have identical stage labels (`Qualified`, `Proposal`) in both. A naive `groupby(stage_label)` double-counts. `schema/stage_ids.py:get_pipeline_stage_labels()` tracks `(pipeline_id, stage_id)` tuples and renders `"Qualified (Sales)"` vs. `"Qualified (Japan)"` in reports. This is not standard HubSpot SDK behavior.

### 3. Consistent Won-Deal Filter

A real prior bug: the team scorecard applied `to_bool_series(hs_is_closed_won)` in Python, while revenue passed `won_only=True` to the HubSpot API filter. The two disagreed on how HubSpot serializes booleans, producing a ~$25K gap between team totals and company totals on one portal. `revenue._fetch_won()` now fetches closed deals once and applies the Python-side filter, so both code paths compute against identical data.

### 4. Probability Normalization for Forecast Bucketing

HubSpot returns stage probabilities as clean floats (`0.8`), noisy floats (`0.80000000000000004`), percentage integers (`80`), or already-normalized fractions. `forecast_bucket._normalize_probability()` detects the form and rounds to two decimals so a `>= 0.8` threshold reliably fires on "commit" stages. Before this, late-stage deals were being silently classified as Best Case.

### 5. Engagement Date Fallback

HubSpot's Search API doesn't consistently honour the same date filter across engagement types — `hs_meeting_start_time` works for meetings but not emails. `ActivityExtractor` tries the type-specific field first, falls back to `hs_lastmodifieddate`, then to an unfiltered search. This fixes the "activity report always shows 0" bug that made engagement metrics useless on some portals.

### 6. Crash-Proof Pandas Helpers

`metrics/_utils.py:to_numeric_series()` / `to_bool_series()` guarantee a valid `pd.Series` even when the DataFrame is empty or the column is missing. Without these, downstream `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.fillna()` calls throw `AttributeError` on low-data portals. This was the root cause of the team-scorecard crash on sandbox accounts.

### 7. Quarter-End Microsecond Precision

`cli.parse_time_range("Q1-2026")` anchors the end date to `23:59:59.999999` on the final day of the quarter, not midnight. Otherwise deals closed between noon and midnight on 31 March silently drop from the Q1 report. Same care is taken for `month` / `last-month` / named months.

### 8. Ghost Deal & Data-Quality Detection

`metrics/_quality.py` surfaces two hygiene issues the HubSpot UI hides:

- **Stale open deals** — `closedate` in the past but `hs_is_closed = false`
- **Ghost deals** — closed-lost deals with zero associated meetings, calls, emails, or notes ("never actually worked")

`metrics/closed_lost.py` additionally warns when fewer than 50% of lost deals have a `closed_lost_reason` populated, because the reason breakdown is unreliable below that threshold.

### 9. Cross-Process Rate Limiter with Separate Search-API Bucket

`client.py` runs two independent token buckets: 100 req/10s for the general CRM API and 5 req/1s for the Search API (which has stricter limits HubSpot doesn't document loudly). Both buckets persist state in JSON files under `~/.hubspot_revops/` and wrap every read-modify-write in an `fcntl.flock` exclusive lock, so **multiple parallel Python processes coordinate through shared buckets** instead of each running an independent limiter that collectively blows past HubSpot's per-portal ceiling. An agent loop that launches nine reports in parallel now serializes their API calls safely instead of triggering 429 cascades.

Paired with a 5-attempt exponential-backoff retry (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s) for 429/5xx, the client survives the contacts-search 502 spikes that crash naive wrappers. On Windows (no `fcntl`) or any environment where `~/.hubspot_revops/` isn't writable, the skill falls back to the in-process limiter and emits a warning — parallel invocations in that fallback mode still need to run sequentially.

### 10. Atomic OAuth Token Cache

`auth.py` saves the refresh token via temp file + `os.replace()` so a process dying mid-write can never corrupt the cache. CSRF state tokens are HMAC-signed. If the refresh token is rotated out from under us, the client falls back to the interactive flow instead of erroring. Tokens live at `~/.hubspot_revops/tokens.json` with `0600` permissions.

### 11. Locked Schema, Deterministic Aggregation

Schema is discovered once per 24h and cached; every metric is computed against that snapshot. Pandas `groupby`/`sum` operations are deterministic. Tiebreakers (e.g. primary currency selection) are alphabetical. Reports generated from the same HubSpot snapshot are byte-exact across runs — critical for audit-grade RevOps reporting where week-over-week comparisons need stable columns.

### 12. Architecturally Read-Only

There are **no HubSpot write methods anywhere in the package**. Not in `client.py`, not in the extractors, not in the reports. The skill cannot create, update, or delete CRM records — even under prompt injection — because the code for doing so doesn't exist. This is a stronger guarantee than "the agent is configured to only read."
